# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding the user's needs is crucial when creating software. This involves gathering and analyzing requirements to ensure the program meets their needs. In Agile development, user stories are a helpful tool for communicating and incorporating user needs. User stories are a clear and concise way to capture what users want, promote collaboration, and align features with user expectations and goals. By putting the user at the center of the development process, this iterative approach ensures software meets their needs.


# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing a project, it's important to consider its specific requirements and constraints in order to create successful and effective programs. Embracing agile values and principles can help achieve efficient, effective, and adaptable software development. It's important to customize agile processes to fit the unique context of your team and project needs.
